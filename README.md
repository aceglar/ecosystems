**European banks face significant vulnerability to ecosystem degradation and climate change**

The code performs three core analytical functions:

(i) Ecosystem Service Dependency Assessment – It calculates the dependency of banks on a range of ecosystem services based on the nature of the economic activities they finance.

(ii) Biodiversity Footprint Estimation – It quantifies the biodiversity footprint of banks by assessing the environmental impact of financed emissions and land use, with a focus on pressures such as greenhouse gas emissions and habitat degradation.

(iii) Network Analysis of Compound Risks – It builds and analyzes a network linking banks’ dependencies on ecosystem services with their exposure to climate risks, highlighting potential compound shocks and their implications for financial stability.

Illustrative examples are included using synthetically generated data to demonstrate the functionality and application of the code.
